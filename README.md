# 🚖 DataStream: Build a Data-centric Web App Using Streamlit

Welcome to **DataStream**! In this project, we’ll learn how to create a data-centric web application using the **Streamlit** library. We’ll focus on visualizing and analyzing New York City taxi traffic data through interactive data visualizations built with **Plotly** and **pydeck**. By the end, you’ll be able to filter, visualize, and analyze data in real-time through a user-friendly web app. Let’s build an insightful web app together! 🌐📊

## 🌐 Project Overview

A data-centric web application focuses on data as the main asset, allowing users to analyze and visualize it interactively. In this project, we’ll use **Streamlit**, a low-code Python framework, to build such an application. We’ll load and visualize NYC taxi traffic data, create interactive filters, and visualize geospatial data with **Plotly** and **pydeck** to uncover traffic trends and patterns.
